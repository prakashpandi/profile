I am an aspiring research engineer, passionate about technology's potential to tackle societal challenges. My journey into the realm of visual computing, particularly within Extended Reality (XR), began with a strong foundation in engineering from my Diploma in Electrical and Electronics Engineering to my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Throughout my career, including roles at `Infosys` and `Siemens Healthineers`, I've actively contributed to XR development initiatives.

Pursuing a `Master's degree in Visual Computing` at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, driven by my passion for innovations in `Computer Vision`, `Robotics`, `Computer Graphics`, and `AI` , with the goal of transitioning from a software developer to a research scientist.
